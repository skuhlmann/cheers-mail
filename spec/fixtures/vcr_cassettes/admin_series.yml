        is an American television [[sitcom]] that originally aired in the United States
        on [[NBC]] between September 30, 1982, and March 31, 1983, in 22 episodes.
        The show was created and produced by director [[James Burrows]] and writers
        [[Glen and Les Charles]], who previously worked on ''''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'''',
        another sitcom. ''''Cheers'''' was produced by [[Charles Burrows Charles Productions]]
        in association with [[Paramount Television]]. The concept and production design
        of the show were inspired by a public house in Boston, the Bull & Finch, which
        is now called [[Cheers Beacon Hill]].\n\nWhen it was first broadcast, critics
        praised the series as intelligent, sophisticated, cleverly written, well-cast,
        and well-timed. However, the [[Nielsen ratings]] for its original runs were
        very low. Typically, low ratings result a show''s cancellation, but before
        the season finale aired, the network renewed it for another season. Reruns
        of season 1  scored higher ratings than its first airing and the series earned
        award recognitions, including five [[35th Primetime Emmy Awards|Emmy Award
        wins in 1983]]. In later years, this season has still elicited positive reviews
        and is currently available on [[DVD]].\n\n== Cast and characters ==\nThis
        season introduces six characters:\n\n* [[Sam Malone]] ([[Ted Danson]]){{mdash}}a
        bartender, bar owner, and retired baseball player. Before the series premiered,
        his baseball career took a toll due to his alcoholism, so he became an owner
        and a bartender of Cheers.\n* [[Diane Chambers]] ([[Shelley Long]]){{mdash}}a
        college-educated, sophisticated academic who is jilted by her fianc\u00e9
        and left without money or a job. Diane is hired by Sam as a waitress. She
        proves to be pretentious, annoys customers with her long-winded speeches,
        and becomes the butt of their jokes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WYAkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=w9cFAAAAIBAJ&dq=carla-tortelli&pg=2740%2C3316051|title=''''Cheers''''

        Perlman]]){{mdash}}a hard-working, \"wisecracking, cynical waitress\".<ref
        name=scott1982/> Carla is a divorced mother of her ex-husband Nick''s four
        children and then becomes pregnant with his fifth child. Diane and Carla do
        not get along and often insult each other.\n* [[Coach Ernie Pantusso|Ernie
        \"Coach\" Pantusso]] ([[Nicholas Colasanto]]){{mdash}}an aging befuddled,
        \"gravelly voiced\"<ref name=scott1982/> retired coach and co-bartender. Coach
        is vulnerable to other people''s exploits, which puts the bar at stake. Coach
        and Sam take care of each other as father and son figures whenever help is
        needed. Nevertheless, he listens to people''s problems and solves them with
        advice and analysis.\n* [[Norm Peterson]] ([[George Wendt]]){{mdash}}a semi-(un)employed
        accountant and bar regular. Whenever Norm enters the bar, people yell out
        his name.\n* [[Cliff Clavin]] ([[John Ratzenberger]]){{mdash}}a postal worker
        and bar regular. Cliff is often present in the bar and his words confuse or
        irritate other people.\n\nThroughout the season, supporting characters are
        explored while Sam and Diane flirt and reject each other. In the season finale,
        no longer resisting their temptations for each other, Sam and Diane passionately
        kiss.\n\nIn the pilot episode''s original script, there were only four principal
        characters: Sam Malone, Diane Chambers, Carla Tortelli, and Ernie \"Coach\"
        Pantusso. Norm Peterson and Cliff Clavin were absent from the original script.
        George Wendt and John Ratzenberger had auditioned for the role of George,
        a character who would have been included in one scene of the pilot episode.{{sfn|Wendt|2009|p=112}}<ref

        know-it-all character Cliff Clavin was added at Ratzenberger''s suggestion.<ref
        name=wendt113-114/> Therefore, influenced by the casting of Wendt and Ratzenberger,
        the pilot script was revised before production began on the show. Wendt became
        part of the program''s regular cast and continued until it ended.{{sfn|Bjorklund|p=281}}
        Ratzenberger was credited in almost every episode for his recurring appearances
        in season 1,{{sfn|Bjorklund|pp=281\u2013295}} and he became part of the regular

        a less-than-bright but flirtatious blonde. Sam and Diane argue about Sam''s
        serial dating of attractive yet unintelligent women, while impatient Brandee
        leaves the bar with someone else, much to Diane''s delight. Later, he uses
        his ex-wife Debra ([[Donna McKechnie]]) as a dating charade, which becomes
        unsuccessful. Humiliated, Sam blames Diane for making him discontent with
        his womanizing ways, and assures her that he will not give up on winning an
        intelligent woman. Sam wins the argument by tricking Diane to fall for him
        after he compliments her blue eyes, although Diane quickly denies her potential
        affection for him. A former customer, Leo ([[Donnelly Rhodes]]), comes to
        the bar seeking advice from Gus, the former owner. When Leo hears that Gus
        is dead, he reluctantly turns to Coach for help. Leo''s son Ron has a fianc\u00e9
        Rick, an African-American man. Coach advises Leo to simply abandon Ron if
        he is \"unhappy about it\". However, Leo mistakes Coach''s advises for deliberate
        reverse-psychology and leaves the bar as an accepting father.<noinclude>\n----\n<small>Gus

        while Axthelm concludes his coverage in Boston. This sketch was the producers''

        season of ''''[[Cheers]]'''''''''', an American television sitcom, originally
        aired on [[NBC]] in the United States between September 27, 1984, and May
        9, 1985. The show was created by director [[James Burrows]] and writers [[Glen
        and Les Charles]] under production team Charles Burrows Charles Productions
        in association with [[Paramount Television]]. The third season is available
        on [[DVD]] in a four-disc set.\n\nThe season marks major events that affected,
        or could have affected, the show. [[Kelsey Grammer]] made his debut as psychiatrist
        [[Frasier Crane]], intended as part of a love triangle with [[Sam and Diane]]
        for the season. Actresses [[Rhea Perlman]] and [[Shelley Long]] were pregnant;
        Perlman''s pregnancy was written into her character ([[Carla Tortelli]]),
        while Long''s was hidden to avoid effects on her character ([[Diane Chambers]]).
        This was the final season for [[Nicholas Colasanto]] as [[Coach Ernie Pantusso]];
        Colasanto died of a heart condition (dating back to the 1970s) which worsened
        during production, contributing to his absence from a number of episodes before
        his death in February 1985.\n\n== Background ==\nDuring the preceding two
        years NBC had struggled to put together a successful Thursday lineup, introducing
        [[Must See TV]]. The initial lineup included the critically acclaimed comedy
        ''''[[Cheers]]'''' and crime series ''''[[Hill Street Blues]]''''. Except
        for ''''Hill Street Blues'''', the other series received low [[Nielsen ratings]].<ref

        (season 2)|previous season]], Sam begins drinking again and indulges in a
        series of affairs; Diane quits, signing herself into a mental hospital to
        forget Sam. She meets upper-class psychiatrist Frasier Crane, and begins dating
        him. Months later, Diane returns to her apartment and learns about Sam''s
        relapse from Coach. With help from Diane, Frasier and Coach, Sam recovers.
        At first Diane decides not to work as a waitress again, but Coach tells her
        if she does not return to the bar Sam will relapse again. Coach also tells
        Sam that Diane will lose her mind again, and tells Frasier that if Diane and
        Sam are apart they would yearn for each other. As a result, Diane returns
        to work at the bar as a waitress. While she is dating Frasier, she and Sam
        flirt with each other.\n\nDiane and Frasier decide to elope to Europe, leaving
        Sam heartbroken once more. One night at the bar Sam and Diane are close to
        making love again, but realize they are uncertain about their future together.
        Before Diane leaves, Sam tells her to call him if she wants to make love again.
        Weeks later Sam, regretting letting Diane go, takes a plane to Italy (with
        Cliff''s help) to stop her from marrying Frasier.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{further|List

        Reception ==\n{{quote box|width=25em|1=...The best thing to happen in [this

        Soon everybody knew his name, and nobody would be able to forget it for twenty-odd
        years (''''[[Frasier]]'''' [recently went] off the airwaves at [[NBC]]). But
        back in 1984, Frasier was cocky, bright-eyed, incredibly youthful, and had
        a lot more hair on his gigantic forehead. His awkward integration into the
        tight-knit group of friends was the subject of many an episode this season,
        as he stuck out like a gigantic tool. By the end of the season, though, he
        ceased to be the nerdy kid nobody liked, and fit in with the gang like a glove.<ref

        especially when its DVD was released in 2004. Nate Meyers of ''''digitallyObsessed!com''''
        gave the  season an \"A\" and called it well-aged and \"nearly flawless\".
        However, Meyers found Coach''s disappearances in the final eight \"somewhat
        awkward\" episodes poorly handled. He pointed out that Coach was not mentioned
        in those episodes, and found the explanations of his disappearances not \"natural\".
        Nevertheless, Meyers praised the season''s writing, [[James Burrows]]''s directing
        (especially for \"[fooling] the audience into believing a dream sequence\"
        in season finale \"[[#ep25|Rescue Me]]\"), the season''s humor as \"character
        and situation driven\" (although \"[a] few jokes are dated\") and its ability
        to focus less on humor and more on \"genuine character moments\" as \"refreshing\"
        compared to other situation comedies of the time.<ref name=digitally-obsessed/>\n\nAdam
        Arseneau of ''''DVD Verdict'''' gave the storylines (including those featuring
        Norm and Cliff) 89 percent and the acting 94 percent. However, Arseneau found
        this season neither the best nor the worst of the series. Although Frasier
        was created to come between [[Sam and Diane]], Arseneau praised the addition
        of the new character but criticized the love-triangle storyline as \"disappointing\".
        Like Meyers, Arseneau disliked the handling of Coach''s \"absence\" for dishonoring
        the memory of Nicholas Colasanto and \"[robbing] fans [of] their opportunity
        to properly and respectfully mourn his passing.\"<ref name=dvdverdict>{{cite

        season four out of five stars and found its DVD release highly rewatchable.
        Robinson said that the plots were uncomplicated, praised the acting and writing
        of this season as \"superb\" and liked the introduction of [[Frasier Crane]].
        Because of Colasanto''s death, he called this season the final one for the
        original \"wonderful\" ensemble cast, finding the mixing of different characters
        in later seasons less accomplished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/10980/cheers-complete-third-season/|title=Cheers:

        career, Frasier frequently visits the Boston bar, Cheers, for drinks and then
        slowly degenerates into [[alcoholism]].  He recovers, then begins another

        a runaway [[Felony|felon]] of fraud and disappears after going to the bathroom.

        happier when he discusses topics with bar mates. Sam''s upper-class date Claudia
        ([[Claudia Cron]]) befriends Diane and invites her for supper at a restaurant.
        Therefore, he ends up alone at one table, leaving two women together at the
        other. Sam tries to seduce Claudia, but she dumps him for being too sexually
        aggressive and less classy. Afterwards, Sam invites Diane for [[cheesecake]]

        the love triangle to continue in the [[Cheers (season 5)|next season]]. A

        Kirstie Alley''s debut performance and was pleased that departing from the

        the new head of the corporation is fired and replaced with a very young, but
        very rich man who falls for Rebecca, making her manager again. He proposes

        eighth season of ''''[[Cheers]]'''', an award-winning American television
        sitcom, originally aired on [[NBC]] in the United States between September
        21, 1989 and May 3, 1990. The show was created by director [[James Burrows]]
        and writers [[Glen and Les Charles]] under production team Charles Burrows
        Charles Productions, in association with [[Paramount Television]].\n\n==Background==\n{{empty
        section|date=August 2013}}\n\n==Season synopsis==\nRebecca begins to fear
        she will die alone and has erotic dreams about Sam, and just as she is about
        to pursue these dreams, the English billionaire Robin Colcord, dazzles Rebecca
        which leads to them dating. Later she finds out he has another girlfriend,
        and so the two women compete for his affections. Eddie is killed by saving
        a fellow team member, by pushing him out of the way of an oncoming ice vehicle,
        but is hit by it himself. At his funeral, Carla learns that Eddie had a secret
        wife, with whom he had a child. Norm gets a stalker in the form of his secretary,
        who believes he fired her because he is attracted to her. Lilith finally gives
        birth to little Frederick, while Frasier is not there, but Sam is! Cliff appears
        on jeopardy and loses all his money on the last question, for making a stupid
        remark. Robin lends Sam, Norm, Cliff and Carla his yacht to enter a race,
        but has a bomb on board. Woody meets Kelly''s mother who performs sexual advances
        towards Woody. Lilith writes a new book for women, which becomes a success,
        based on why some men are bad for women, which she based on Sam. Rebecca realizes
        that Robin has used her to gain access to the company''s accounts and becomes
        unsure as to whether she should turn him over to the police.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*

        her to Boston after a trip to France. Unbeknownst to her, his plan is to steal
        her away from Woody, who in turn becomes jealous and worried. Sam suggests
        a motel to improve Woody and Kelly''s relationship. Later, Woody takes Kelly
        out to a cheap motel for their evening together. However, Carla arrives to
        stop them from doing it in the motel and tells them that making out in a cheap
        motel is a bad idea and bad luck for their precious love. Therefore, the couple
        decide to save their moment for the right time, while Carla brings in and
        tries to seduce Henr\u00ed. Meanwhile, Cliff tells his friends that he plans
        to [[Cryonics|freeze his head after death]], but they mock him and his plans.
        Therefore, Cliff and Frasier pull a prank on the other patrons by bringing
        a box of apparently a frozen head to the bar, which turn out to be only a
        [[microcassette]] in a metal box. In the end, Norm and Paul pull a prank on
        Cliff, walking through the bar apparently [[Decapitation|decapitated]]. <br>
