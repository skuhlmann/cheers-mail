        ''''''first season'''''' of ''''[[Friends]]'''', an American [[sitcom]] created
        by [[David Crane (producer)|David Crane]] and [[Marta Kauffman]], premiered
        on [[NBC]] on September 22, 1994.\n\n''''Friends'''' was produced by [[Bright/Kauffman/Crane
        Productions]], in association with [[Warner Bros. Television]]. The season
        contains 24 episodes and concluded airing on May 18, 1995.\n\n==Season synopsis==\nThis
        season introduces the six main characters: [[Rachel Green]], [[Monica Geller]],
        [[Phoebe Buffay]], [[Joey Tribbiani]], [[Chandler Bing]] and [[Ross Geller]].
        Rachel, who left her fianc\u00e9 at the altar on her wedding day, has come
        to New York and ends up living with Monica. It establishes early on in the
        season that Ross has been in love with Rachel since the two characters attended
        high school. Several episodes revolve around his attempts to tell her how
        he feels. Meanwhile, Ross''s estranged lesbian ex-wife Carol is pregnant with
        his baby. This puts Ross and Carol''s lesbian life partner, Susan, in an awkward
        position. Due to the loneliness Ross brings home Marcel, a capucin monkey.<ref>{{cite
        web|first=Angie|title=\"Friends\" The One with the Monkey|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0583630/plotsummary|accessdate=12
        November 2012}}</ref> When the baby is born at the end of the season, Ross,
        Carol, and Susan agree to name him Ben after a name tag on a janitor''s uniform
        worn by Phoebe. The episodic nature of the season sees the characters learning
        moral lessons about life and having multiple dates, many of which go wrong
        (Monica dates a minor in one episode), yet each episode still ended happily.
        The recurring character of Janice is introduced as a girlfriend Chandler breaks
        up with in an early episode but frequently returns to throughout the next
        two seasons. Ross leaves for a fossil dig in China at the end of the season,
        but when Chandler lets it slip about Ross''s continuing feelings for Rachel
        on her birthday, she is shocked to find out. She rushes off to the airport
        to tell him about her feelings, only to find out that he has a new girlfriend.\n\n==Production==\n{{see

        appearing in ''''[[Monty (TV series)|Monty]]'''', but changed his mind when
        he learned that it was an ensemble script.<ref>Wild, p. 177</ref> Unknown
        to him, Crane and Kauffman had remembered him from when he auditioned for
        an earlier pilot of theirs; they had written the part of Ross with Schwimmer
        in mind to play him.<ref name=\"W209\"/>  Crane and Kauffman wanted Joey to
        be \"a guy''s guy\" who loves \"women, sports, women, New York, women\". [[Matt

        being considered for Monica. Her commitment as an actress on the television
        series ''''Muddling Through'''' left her part in ''''Friends'''' in doubt;
        ''''Muddling Through'''' was not scheduled to be broadcast by CBS until mid-1994,
        after NBC''s announcement of whether ''''Friends'''' would be [[greenlight|greenlit]]
        for a series. If ''''Muddling Through'''' became a ratings success, the role
        of Rachel would have needed recasting, as the producer of ''''Muddling Through''''
        would not allow Aniston to be released from her contract. A deal was eventually
        struck and, within three days of first auditioning, Aniston got the role.<ref>Brownfield,

        season'''''' of ''''[[Friends]]'''', an American [[situation comedy]] created
        by [[David Crane (producer)|David Crane]] and [[Marta Kauffman]], premiered
        on [[NBC]] on September 21, 1995. ''''Friends'''' was produced by [[Bright/Kauffman/Crane
        Productions]], in association with [[Warner Bros. Television]]. The season
        contains 24 episodes and concluded airing on May 16, 1996. ''''[[TV Guide]]''''
        placed the season 31st on their list of 100 all-time greatest television seasons,
        and one of the three seasons of Friends on the list.\n\n==Season synopsis==\n\nUnlike
        the first season, this season features more serialized storylines{{fact|date=September
        2014}}; it begins when Rachel discovers that Ross \"dumped\" her for Julie,
        a woman he knew from grad school. Julie returns for several episodes early
        in the season. Rachel''s attempts to tell Ross she likes him mirror his own
        failed attempts in the first season, but she accidentally lets it slip out
        in a drunken voicemail message. When Ross finds out, he dumps Julie, but Rachel
        is angry because of a list of bad things that he wrote about her to help him
        decide between the two of them. Eventually, a prom video reveals that Ross
        intended to take Rachel to the prom when her date was late. This makes Rachel
        forgive him and they begin a relationship that lasts into the following season.\n\nJoey,
        a struggling actor in the first season, gets a part in a fictionalized version
        of the soap opera Days of Our Lives but loses the part soon after when he
        angers the writers by saying in an interview that he writes many of his own
        lines. Tom Selleck begins a recurring guest role as Dr. Richard Burke. Richard,
        a friend of Monica and Ross''s parents who is recently divorced and with grown
        children, is 21 years older than Monica but despite this they date for the
        second half of the season. In the season finale, they end the relationship
        when they realize that he does not want any more children and she does.\n\nThe
        second season also served to deepen Chandler and Joey''s friendship. This
        becomes especially apparent in the episodes in which Joey temporarily moves
        out and a man named Eddie Menuek moves in. Chandler is disgusted that Eddie
        does not like what he likes, and has trouble bonding with him, so he allows
        Joey to move in and pretends that Eddie never lived there. Eddie''s mental
        illness causes him to believe that he really has never met Chandler when Chandler
        insists this is the case and leaves him alone. Another surprise comes when
        Chandler falls in love with a woman over the Internet and when he goes to
        meet her at Central Perk, Janice his ex walks in. Despite this, they decide
        to get back together, for real this time.\n\nThis is the only season (excluding
        the final season) of the entire series in which the season finale does not
        lead to the immediate beginning of the first episode of the following season.\n\n==Cast
