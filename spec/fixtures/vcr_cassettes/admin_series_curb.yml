        |DirectedBy=[[Robert B. Weide]]\n |WrittenBy=[[Larry David]]\n |ShortSummary=In
        the HBO special upon which the series was based, Larry approaches HBO about
        having his own hour-long HBO special. After a long hiatus, Larry begins performing
        stand-up comedy again in order to prepare for the special. However, hours
        away from the show''s scheduled filming, Larry becomes nervous and lies to
        the HBO executives about the illness of his nonexistent stepfather in order
        to get the special canceled.\n}}\n|}\n\n===Season 1 (2000)===\nThe first season
        introduces us to Larry''s post-''''Seinfeld'''' world, where he is wealthy,
        has a loving wife, a best friend, and also manages to offend everyone around
        him. It is not long into the series though that we realize that Larry David
        is his own worst enemy. He is accused of having an adultery-implying erection
        because of his extremely baggy trousers that bunch up when he sits down; feuding
        with a shoe salesman; getting blamed for a newspaper typo after submitting
        an obituary for Cheryl''s aunt; reacting offensively to drinking from his
        friend''s mother''s glass; and unintentionally causing someone to believe
        that his uncle is an incestuous pedophile. Although this season has no major
        plot line, there is a small plot of Larry trying to obtain a bracelet to give
        to Cheryl and another small two-episode plot involving Larry and Cheryl trying
        to have a wire that runs through their backyard removed.\n{| class=\"wikitable

        (Mina Kolb, [[Louis Nye]])--backfire disastrously. [[Kathy Griffin]] makes

        who starred in a megahit sitcom who finds it difficult to maintain a steady
        career afterward because of the public''s perception of typecasting. Larry
        pitches the idea to various networks, but eventually ends up alienating or
        offending everyone he makes a deal with, and anyone else attached to the project.\n{|
